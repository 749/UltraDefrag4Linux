 * <h2>Creating a compressed archive to submit</h2>
 * It is best to ZIP your collected files into a single compressed archive, which will reduce the up- and download size immensely.
 * If you do not own a ZIP utility, check out <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sevenzip/">7-zip</a>.
 * Windows XP and above include the ability to create ZIP archives through the Explorer right-click menu <b>Send To => Compressed Folder</b>.
 *
 * @note
 * The Sourceforge trackers only allow uploading files of 256KB in size.
 * For bigger files you may use one of the free file hosting services.
