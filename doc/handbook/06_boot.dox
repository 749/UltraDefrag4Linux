/**
 * @page Boot Boot Time Defragmentation
 *
 * UltraDefrag also includes a new mode that allows you to run it
 * at boot time in a manner similar to chkdsk. This is known as a
 * native application. The primary goal of it is defragmentation
 * of locked files. UltraDefrag runs at Windows boot before any 
 * file locking, so it can defragment almost everything,
 * including page and hibernation files.
 * <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/screenshots.html">View screenshots...</a>
 *
 * If the boot time defragmenter is enabled, it will run
 * at every boot.
 * @note
 * You will have a chance to exit immediately, just press any key when the appropriate
 * prompt is displayed. If no key is pressed during this delay, the boot time script will be executed.
 *
 * You can always stop the disk analysis/defragmentation by pressing
 * the Pause/Break key on the keyboard.
 *
 * The following restrictions exist for the boot time scans:
 * - You may not scan encrypted disks. This is because lsass.exe, the component
 * of the operating system that reads encrypted disks, is still not loaded
 * at a time of the native applications execution.
 * - In Windows Safe Mode the program cannot display text on the boot screen.
 * UltraDefrag checks for boot options and returns immediately, if the
 * Safe Mode flag has been found.
 *
 * The boot time defragmenter can be enabled/disabled either from 
 * the main GUI window or by typing boot-on/boot-off commands in
 * the command prompt.
 *
 * <h1>Boot Time Modes</h1>
 * The boot time defragmenter can be executed in two modes:
 * @par Boot time script
 * The boot time script consists of the disk defragmentation commands,
 * ancillary commands and comments.
 * It is located at <b>\%windir\%\\system32\\ud-boot-time.cmd</b>.
 * To edit this file execute boot-config at the command prompt or simply click
 * the Boot time script button on the UltraDefrag GUI toolbar.
 * <br/><br/>
 * The boot time script simplifies also the use of UltraDefrag on
 * computers running Windows 98. After installing Windows XP as a second
 * operating system, UltraDefrag may be installed too. After adding the
 * shutdown command to the boot time script you may simply boot the XP system
 * (which requires much less resources at boot time!) and safely leave your
 * computer. It will be shut down automatically after the job is completed.
 * <br/><br/>
 * To abort the script execution and enter the interactive mode immediately
 * hit <b>ESC</b> at any time during the boot time script processing.
 *
 * @par Interactive mode
 * When the exit command is missing in the boot time script UltraDefrag
 * runs in interactive mode after the last script command is executed.
 * UltraDefrag displays the following command prompt and waits
 * for the users input:
 * <br/>
@verbatim
Interactive mode:
Type 'help' for list of supported commands.

#
@endverbatim
 * <br/>
 * All commands displaying long lists (help, hexview, history, man, set, type)
 * are splitting them into pages in interactive mode.
 *
 * <h1>Available Boot Time Commands</h1>
 * @par ; or \#
 * Lines starting with one of these characters are treated as comments.
 *
 * @par \@
 * Do not show the command line preceded by the at-sign on the screen.
 * By default the command line is displayed on the screen.
 *
 * @par boot-on
 * Turn on the boot time defragmentation to be executed at every boot.
 *
 * @par boot-off
 * Turn off the boot time defragmentation. It prevents them from being
 * executed at next reboots. Until you will enable them manually through
 * UltraDefrag Configuration dialog or boot-on.cmd script.
 *
 * @par call
 * Similar to the DOS command.
 * Executes the specified script.
 * If no script is specified, the default boot time script is executed.
 *
 * @par echo
 * Similar to the DOS command.
 * Display a message, empty line, enable/disable showing the command line on the screen
 * or display the status of showing the command line.
 *
 * @par exit
 * Similar to the DOS command.
 * Break the boot time program execution and return the specified error code or zero.
 *
 * @par help
 * Show a list of all available commands.
 *
 * @par hexview
 * Display the contents of the specified file in a HEX viewer layout.
 * <br/>
@verbatim
000000C0: 0a 00 3b 00 20 00 46 00 |   ;   F
000000C8: 72 00 61 00 67 00 6d 00 | r a g m
000000D0: 65 00 6e 00 74 00 65 00 | e n t e
@endverbatim
 *
 * @par history
 * Show a list of all manually entered commands.
 * To cycle through the commands use the up/down arrow/cursor keys.
 *
 * @par man
 * List or display available manual pages.
 *
 * @par pause
 * Pause the script execution for the specified time interval (in milliseconds, 2147483647 maximum)
 * or till a key is pressed, if no duration is specified.
 * For example, the command <b>pause 1000</b> will pause execution for one second.
 *
 * @par reboot
 * Reboot the computer.
 *
 * @par set
 * Similar to the DOS command.
 * List, set and clear environment variables.
 * For further information about the supported variables consult the @ref Console page.
 *
 * @par shutdown
 * Halt the computer.
 *
 * @par type
 * Similar to the DOS command.
 * Display the contents of a file, the default is the boot time script.
 *
 * @par udefrag
 * This is the native equivalent of the UltraDefrag command line tool.
 * The following command switches are supported:<br/><br/>
 * <b>-l, -la, -a, -o, -q, --quick-optimize, --optimize-mft, --all, --all-fixed, -r, --repeat</b><br/><br/>
 * Multiple drive letters on a single command line are allowed.<br/>
 * You can specify <b>absolute paths</b> to process single files or directories.
 * Paths including spaces must be enclosed by double quotes (").
 * To specify multiple paths separate them by spaces.<br/><br/>
 * Example:
 * @code
 * udefrag "C:\Documents and Settings" C:\\WINDOWS\\WindowsUpdate.log
 * @endcode
 * <br/>
 * For further information about the command switches and variables consult the @ref Console page.
 *
 * When UltraDefrag encounters the wrong syntax it shows an appropriate
 * message on the screen and continues the script execution.
 *
 * <h1>Environment variable expansion</h1>
 * The boot time script and the interactive mode support environment variable expansion.
 * This allows a more flexible script to be written by using <b>\%SystemDrive\%</b> instead of <b>C:</b>.
 * In addition to the regular variables there are two variables, <b>DATE</b> and <b>TIME</b>,
 * that will be set dynamically.
 * Both are formated to be easily used as part of a file name, so a timestamped log
 * file name can be created.
 *
 * @par DATE
 * This will be expanded to the current date in the format <b>YYYY-MM-DD</b>
 * @code
 * echo DATE ... %DATE%
 * @endcode
 * Results in the display of:
@verbatim
DATE ... 2012-02-14
@endverbatim
 *
 * @par TIME
 * This will be expanded to the current time in the format <b>HH-MM</b>
 * @code
 * echo TIME ... %TIME%
 * @endcode
 * Results in the display of:
@verbatim
TIME ... 12-04
@endverbatim
 *
 * <h1>Boot time script example</h1>
 * The following script is used by default:
 * @code
 * @echo off
