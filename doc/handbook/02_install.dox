/**
 * @page Installation Installation
 *
 * To obtain the latest version of the program please visit the 
 * <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ultradefrag/files/">project's download page</a>.
 *
 * @note
 * You must be an administrator to install and run UltraDefrag.<br /><br />
 * You must have a 64-bit version of Windows to run the 64-bit versions of the program.
 * The IA-64 version was never tested by the authors. It requires the Intel Itanium processor
 * and an appropriate 64-bit edition of Windows.
 *
 * There are two different types of packages available for download:
 * @par Full-featured installer
 * It installs all of the program features, but requires installation
 * therefore cannot be used directly from USB sticks.<br/><br/>
 * The installer allows installing the <b>UltraDefrag Micro Edition</b> too, which is a lightweight version
 * of the program containing only the command line tool and the boot time defragmenter.
 * It is intended to be used from the console only.
 *
 * @par Portable package
 * Download it, unpack it and use without an installation. 
 * Copy it on an USB stick and you will be able to use UltraDefrag everywhere by simply
 * running it from there.
 * @note
 * The boot time defragmenter is missing from the portable 
 * packages, but all other features are included. 
 * You can find more information about portable applications
 * <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_application">here</a>.<br/><br/>
 * 
 * To expand usage statistics gathering by the website UltraDefrag sends also
 * requests to the <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> 
 * service during startup. It takes no negative effect on security - many thousands
 * of websites around the world use the same service to gather basic statistics
 * of use. However, the UltraDefrag usage tracking can be turned off during an 
 * installation.
 *
 * <h1>Silent Installation</h1>
 * UltraDefrag can be installed in silent mode by adding the <b>/S</b> switch to the installer's command line
 * at the command prompt. In this case no dialogs will be shown and the program will be installed 
 * to the hard drive completely with all the features enabled.<br/>
 * @note
 * For easier debugging of installation problems a log file will be created when an error is encontered.
 * The log file is located in the temporary folder of the executing user: <b>\%TMP\%\\UltraDefrag_Install.log</b>
 *
 * The following additional command line switches are supported:
 * @par /LANG
 * Select the language to be installed. For example, 
 * use <b>/LANG="German"</b> to install the German language pack.<br/>

 *
 * @par /D={Install Location}
 * This sets the installation folder for UltraDefrag. Example: <b>/D=C:\\Program Files\\UltraDefrag</b>.<br/>
 * It must be the last parameter used in the command line and must not contain any quotes, even if the path contains spaces.<br/>
 * Only absolute paths are supported. The destination folder must be empty or contain a previous UltraDefrag installation.
 *
 * Example command line to silently install the full edition in "Burmese (Padauk)" with only the start menu icon:
 * @code
 * ultradefrag.bin.i386.exe /S /LANG="Burmese (Padauk)" /FULL=1 /ICONS=0 /STARTMENUICON=1 /D=C:\Program Files\UltraDefrag
 * @endcode
 * To check the result of the command line switches omit the <b>/S</b> switch,
 * which opens the interactive installer and allows checking the selections
 * on the component page.
 *
 * There is also a silent mode for the uninstaller program.
 * At the command prompt type:
 * @code
 * %UD_INSTALL_DIR%\uninstall.exe /S
 * @endcode
 * to automatically remove the program from the hard drive without any graphical dialogs.
