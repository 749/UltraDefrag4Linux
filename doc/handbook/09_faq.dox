/**
 * @page FAQ Frequently Asked Questions
 * <h1>Installer</h1>
 * <h3>How can I determine which installer to download?</h3>
 * -# open the <b>Run</b> dialog by hitting [Windows]+R
 * -# type <b>cmd.exe /K echo \%PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE\%</b>
 * -# hit the OK button
 * -# examine the top-left corner of the opened command prompt window
 *     - If it reads <b>x86</b> you download the <b>i386</b> installer.
 *     - If it reads <b>AMD64</b> you download the <b>amd64</b> installer.
 *     - If it reads <b>IA64</b> you download the <b>ia64</b> installer.
 *
 * <h3>Can I up- or downgrade over an existing installation?</h3>
 * The installer is written to support up- and downgrading without the need
 * to remove a previous version.
 * In addition, usually it is not needed to reboot.
 *
 * <h3>Can I specify a custom installation folder?</h3>
 * Starting with version 5.1.0 it is supported to specify the install
 * location. The installer validates the selected location, since only
 * empty and existing UltraDefrag installation folders are supported.
 *
 * <h3>How can I check what went wrong with my silent installation?</h3>
 * Starting with version 5.1.0 a log file is created at
 * <b>\%TMP\%\\UltraDefrag_Install.log</b>.
 *
 * <h1>General Usage</h1>
 * <h3>After defragmentation I see my restore points disappeared, what happens?</h3>
 * This is a normal situation when restore points disappear after an
 * intensive disk processing. Windows limits amount of disk space
 * reserved for restore points. When you perform intensive disk
 * processing, Windows tracks changes through system restore, therefore
 * the mentioned limit may be easily exceeded which results in old
 * restore points deletion.
 *
 * We would recommend to avoid the use of restore points for serious
 * purposes, because Windows can never guarantee that some point saved in
 * the past will be available in the next moment. Use backup software
 * instead, Windows already has such a program and there are also lots of
 * 3-rd party programs of such kind.
 *
 * <h3>How can I determine the fragmentation percentage of a drive?</h3>
 * Starting with version 5.1.0 the analysis calculates the fragmentation
 * percentage.<br/>
 * It is displayed in the <b>Fragmentation</b> column of the
 * drive list of the GUI and when you run the command line tool using the
 * <b>-v</b> command line parameter.<br/>
 * You can run an analysis of a drive from the Explorer context menu too.
 *
 * <h3>How can I optimize similar to v5.x.x in v6.x.x?</h3>
 * Starting with version 6.0.0 the optimization no longer ignores filters.
 * In addition there is a new filter added that skips files of a specified
 * size when running optimization.<br/>
 * To get a similar behavior of v5 in v6, you need to disable/unset all filters
 * and set the variable <b>UD_OPTIMIZER_FILE_SIZE_THRESHOLD</b> for the boot time
 * and console interfaces
 * respectively the setting <b>optimizer_file_size_threshold</b> for the GUI
 * to <b>15 EB</b>.
 *
 * <h1>Graphical Interface</h1>
 * <h3>Where can I find a legend of the cluster map colors?</h3>
 * The colors are described in the <b>Cluster Map</b> section of the @ref GUI page. 
 *
 * <h3>When will the cluster map become interactive, so I'll be able to know where
 * individual files are located on disk?</h3>
 * When defragmentation algorithms are quite effective, this is not necessary
 * to know location of individual files - anyway you'll get your drive optimized
 * quite well. Maybe we'll implement the discussed feature later, but now we prefer
 * to concentrate our forces on a disk optimization algorithm improvements.
 *
 * <h3>Why configuration files editing is better than one settings window with tabs?</h3>
 * It is much easier and reliable to use the
 * standard Notepad application to edit
 * configuration files.
 *
 * <h3>Why does the progress percentage update irregularly?</h3>
 * The progress percentage measures disk space, not the number of files. So when few 
 * big files are analyzed, the progress will increase very fast. 
 * Conversely, when thousands of small files are analyzed, progress will 
 * be relatively slow.
 *
 * <h3>Why is the progress exceeding 100\%, when processing FAT disks?</h3>
 * On FAT disks space is immediately released after a file is moved,
 * so it happens, that more files can be fully defragmented, than initially
 * calculated. 
 *
 * <h3>Why is the disk name not displayed?</h3>
 * Explorer replaces an empty disk name by <b>Local Disk</b> or similar, 
 * UltraDefrag does not replace an empty disk name with any default. 
 *
 * <h3>Why is only the last report displayed, if I choose to display multiple reports?</h3>
 * Browsers which do not support tabbed browsing are reusing the same window.
 * This is a limitation of the way a HTML page is opened from within Explorer.
 *
 * <h3>Why are multiple windows opened, if I choose to display multiple reports?</h3>
 * If your browser supports tabbed browsing open one instance of your default browser
 * before you display the reports. This will open each report in a new tab depending
 * on your browsers configuration.
 *
 * <h1>Command Line Tool</h1>
 * <h3>How can I process all disks except a few?</h3>
 * You can use the filter variables to do this.
 * For instance you like to defragment all fixed drives except C and S.\n
 * To achieve this you use <b>set UD_EX_FILTER=C:\\*;S:\\*</b> and execute
 * <b>udefrag \--all-fixed</b>.\n
 * The analysis will be executed for any drive, but defragmentation will be
 * skipped for drive C and S.\n
 * The analysis will not be complete for excluded FAT disks, because the
 * driver does only check the root folder of excluded disks.
 *
 * <h1>Boot time processing</h1>
 * <h3>What is the best configuration for boot disks?</h3>
 * For NTFS it should be sufficient to use quick optimization.
 * For FAT it is highly recommended to convert the boot disk into NTFS
 * due to performance and security reasons.
 *
 * <h3>Why are there still some files fragmented?</h3>
 * Some system configurations are locking files even at boot, which can't be prevented. 
 * In some cases the size of the free space regions is not big enough to hold the entire file,
 * this can be corrected by using quick optimization, which consolidates free space.
 *
 * <h1>Miscellaneous</h1>
 * <h3>How can I disable the boot time defragmenter manually?</h3>
 * If something goes wrong and the boot-off script does not work properly, remove the 
 * defrag_native entry from the following system registry parameter manually:
 *
@verbatim
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\BootExecute
@endverbatim
 *
 * <h3>I have set UD_LOG_FILE_PATH or log_file_path, but the log file is not created?</h3>
 * If creating the log file fails for any reason, UltraDefrag tries to create
 * the log file in the temporary folder of the current user.\n
 * Only if creating the log file in the temporary fails too, there will be no log file
 * created.\n
 * The default temporary location for the GUI and console edition is:
 * <b>\%TMP\%\\UltraDefrag_Logs\\{filename}</b>\n
 * The default temporary location for boot time defrag is:
 * <b>\%SystemRoot\%\\UltraDefrag_Logs\\{filename}</b>\n
 * The file name is the one from the specified log file path variable.
 *
 * <h3>How many differences are between the Ultra Defragmenter and well known MyDefrag (previously JkDefrag)?</h3>
 * Both programs have similar disk analysis algorithms, but defragmentation is done
 * in different ways. While MyDefrag tends to give more control over a
 * files placement, UltraDefrag is designed to be as simple and fast as possible.
 * So, UltraDefrag never uses a complex disk optimization strategies, because their use
 * often noticeably increases the processing time.
 *
 * The biggest advantages of UltraDefrag are an ability to defragment system files at
 * boot time, nice graphical interface, handy reports and instant availability of sources
 * licensed under GPL.
 *
 * The main disadvantage of both applications (UltraDefrag and MyDefrag) is that they
 * are based on the Windows defragmenting interface that has a very ugly implementation. We cannot
 * change this, because it is part of the filesystem drivers (ntfs.sys, fastfat.sys),
 * which are too complex and not open source to modify or replace them.
