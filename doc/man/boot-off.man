BOOT-OFF(1)        UltraDefrag Boot Time Commands         BOOT-OFF(1)

NAME
        boot-off - manual page for boot-off v7.0.0

SYNOPSIS
        boot-off

DESCRIPTION
        'boot-off' turns the boot time defragmenter off.
        If it's followed by the shutdown or reboot command 
        a flag file is created to apply the change at the
        next boot, since otherwise it will be lost due to
        a Windows limitation.
