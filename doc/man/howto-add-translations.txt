copyright rules:
 1. http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/maintain.html#Legally-Significant
 2. since language files are quite small, we consider to assign copyright
    to anyone who contributed more than around ten lines of text
 3. any person contributed less than around ten lines of text deserves 
    to be mentioned however in 'Special thanks' list of the 'Credits and 
    License' chapter of the UltraDefrag handbook - sure, even a minor
    improvements help us to move forward in right direction to our target
