HISTORY(1)         UltraDefrag Boot Time Commands          HISTORY(1)

NAME
        history - manual page for history v7.0.0

SYNOPSIS
        history

DESCRIPTION
        'history' displays the list of all manually entered commands.
        You can reuse previously entered commands in interactive mode
        by using the up/down cursor/arrow keys. In scripting mode
        the list is empty, since there is no way to enter commands
        manually. In interactive mode the list is displayed page-wise.
