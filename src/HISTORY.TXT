  Beta Stage
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    All versions listed below were treated as stable and so on, but actually 
    they were highly unreliable. Program's internal structure is very complex, 
    it uses a lot of undocumented Windows calls. Therefore bug hunting was
    always extremely hard, especially in early days when an author had 
    no enough experience.

    In other words, all versions prior to 4.0.0 must be treated as products 
    of the beta stage of program's development.


  Version 3.3.0  2009-12-04
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - volume optimization algorithm was highly improved
    - fragments threshold filter parameter was added
    - UD_TIME_LIMIT option was added
    - portable version was highly improved
    - few little bugs were fixed
    - now the program is much more compatible with Vista and later versions 
      of Windows; this is achieved by adding the User Mode Driver to it
    - program's reliability increased by removing error handlers caused 
      infinite loops
    - now the program can be used in Windows Safe Mode when the user mode 
      driver is enabled

    - since this version native 64-bit binaries aren't available
      due to the C compilers internal bugs (Windows DDK, Windows SDK, Pelles C, 
      MinGW x64 were tested); portable UltraDefrag can be used now on all of the  
      64-bit systems instead of the native 64-bit packages

    - NOTE FOR PROGRAMMERS: to successfully compile the user mode driver run 
      configure.lua script, check 'Apply patch to MinGW' box and click OK 
      once again

      detailed instructions about kernel mode driver debugging instead
    - few fatal driver bugs were fixed
    - driver's reliability was increased
    - now UltraDefrag requires less software for its development
    - FOR PROGRAMMERS: build configurator was rewritten in Lua
    - NOTE FOR PROGRAMMERS: to successfully recompile the driver run 
      configure.pl script and click 'Apply patch to MinGW' button once again
