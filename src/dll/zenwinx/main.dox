 *
 * <h2>ZenWINX?</h2>
 * It is a framework for Windows Native applications development.
 * Such applications are running during the Windows boot process 
 * in a manner similar to chkdsk. The following native applications
 * are well known too:
 * - xmnt2002.exe is a native part of the Partition Magic software
 * - smss.exe is one of the most important Windows components
 *   participating in the Windows boot process
 * 
 * Using ZenWINX library you may easily create your own native 
 * application. This library gives you over 100 functions which
 * highly simplifies the Windows native development. Also it 
 * contains a Native Development Kit header file with a lot of
 * definitions required for the native development.
 * 
 * ZenWINX is fully compatible with Windows NT 4.0, Windows 2000,
 * Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows Vista, 
 * Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 and all of the 64-bit editions
 * of Windows.
 *
 * <h2>Projects</h2>
 * ZenWINX library is currently used in the following projects:
 * - <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net">UltraDefrag</a> - a little
 * shell included there allows to defragment hard drives as well as shutdown and 
 * reboot the computer before the Windows logon.
 * - <a href="http://hex.pp.ua/nt-native-applications-shell-eng.php">Native shell</a> - 
 * this little program runs before the Windows logon too. It allows
 * to navigate through the file system, copy and delete files, display directory
 * listings and more.
 *
 * If you know other projects not listed here, please send me a note and I will
 * expand the list.
 *
 * <h2>Compilation</h2>
 * Actually at this moment ZenWINX is a part of the 
 * <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net">UltraDefrag</a> 
 * project. You should therefore download the latest sources of them
 * to compile ZenWINX library. Detailed information is 
 * <a href="http://ultradefrag.sourceforge.net/handbook/development.html">here</a>.
